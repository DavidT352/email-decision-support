# Professional Email Decision Support

This repository documents a project exploring how AI can help professionals decide **what to do next** when replying to difficult, high-stakes emails.

The focus is not on writing better emails, but on **reducing risk** in situations involving clients, managers, HR, suppliers, or other stakeholders where wording, timing, and tone matter.

## The Problem

Difficult professional emails often trigger:
- emotional reactions
- overthinking and multiple drafts
- second-guessing and delays
- defensive or apologetic replies
- accidental concessions or escalation

In high-pressure situations, a “polite” or “helpful” reply can unintentionally make things worse.

## The Approach (High Level)

Instead of generating generic responses, this project focuses on:
- identifying what an incoming email is *really doing* (pressure, assumptions, escalation, blame)
- determining the **safest next step**
- suggesting a reply that improves the recipient’s position without escalating or conceding unnecessarily

The goal is to help professionals move from uncertainty to clarity before replying.

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Implied Scope Creep

**Incoming email:**
> “Based on what you shared, we assumed these additional items would be included. Please confirm today so we can finalize budgeting.”

**What the email is doing:**
- Assumes agreement without confirmation
- Applies time pressure to force commitment

**Safer next step:**
Clarify scope before confirming anything.

**Example reply:**
> “Please provide a written list of the specific items you’re referring to and when these were discussed. Once I have that, I’ll review them against our current scope and confirm next steps.”

### Example 2: Passive-Aggressive Authority Pressure

**Incoming email:**
> “We already discussed this and shouldn’t still be revisiting fundamentals. Leadership is asking questions. Please proceed accordingly.”

**What the email is doing:**
- Rewrites prior agreement
- Applies authority pressure
- Pushes for execution without clarity

**Safer next step:**
Require specifics before acting.

**Example reply:**
> “To ensure alignment, please share the specific decisions or notes from our prior discussion that define the agreed approach. Once I have those details, I’ll confirm how to proceed.”
